# C-project-layout
A simple layout for C projects

This is a work in progress, feedback is always welcome.

Directory explanation:
- /src for source files.
- /src/test for testing of the source code.
- /src/Makefile for building your project with make.
- /doc for documentation that is not provided in the source files.
- /lib for storing libraries that will be used in your project.
- /static for static files like textures, images and sounds.
